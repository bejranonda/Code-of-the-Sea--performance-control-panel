## üé® Project Overview

**Code of the Sea** is an interactive installation exploring how humans might adapt in an age of constant physical and digital migration. Inspired by the horseshoe crab‚Äôs protective shell, it imagines future nomads merging clothing, shelter, and technology into one adaptive shell.

The control panel transforms a Raspberry Pi into the **nervous system of this technological organism**, coordinating LEDs, FM radio, live audio, wind, and environmental sensors through a unified Flask web interface. Technology becomes a living, responsive layer‚Äîprotective, adaptive, and alive.

Exhibited in Germany and South Korea, the system proved exhibition-grade reliable, self-monitoring, and self-healing‚Äîan intelligent organism integrating light, sound, and environment into a seamless, resilient whole.

## üßê If you need to understand more

### ‚ùì What It Does (Value for different audiences)

> "Inspired by the ancient horseshoe crab (*limule*), whose resilient exoskeleton has ensured its survival for millions of years"

**Code of the Sea** reimagines this natural armor as a technological shell‚Äîone that protects, connects, and amplifies interactive art. The system integrates light, sound, communication, and environmental sensing into a unified, adaptive platform for immersive installations.

- **For Artists & Curators:** Exhibition-ready multimedia controller running autonomously 24/7. Orchestrate audio-reactive lights, mix audience voices into soundscapes, tune FM radio, monitor environmental conditions‚Äîall through a single web interface.

- **For Exhibition Visitors:** Experience art that breathes and responds. Lights pulse with musical rhythm, your voice becomes part of the sonic landscape, the environment participates‚Äîcreating immersive spaces where technology dissolves into artistic expression.

- **For Developers & Makers:** Production-ready IoT platform demonstrating professional Raspberry Pi orchestration. Real-time hardware control (I2C sensors, PWM outputs, audio processing), comprehensive monitoring, automatic recovery, modular architecture adaptable for any interactive installation.

### üé≠ The Experience (What people encounter)

> "In a world of constant movement‚Äîphysical migration, digital nomadism, cultural displacement‚Äîthis installation embodies **future nomads** who carry their entire environment integrated as a protective technological shell."

The title **"Code of the Sea"** explores how machines interpret human experiences‚Äîmigration, memory, identity‚Äîtranslating the fluid, boundless nature of existence into discrete signals, like decoding the vast ocean's depths.

**The Installation as Living System:**
- **Light**: Audio-reactive and ambient-responsive luminous environment
- **Sound**: Audience voices mixed into master tracks, becoming part of the soundscape
- **Radio**: Connects to broader electromagnetic spectrum
- **Wind**: Controlled airflow creates breathing patterns, responds to heat and light
- **Environmental Sensing**: Temperature and light monitoring, reacting to gallery space
- **Solar Energy**: Self-sustaining power from 6√ó2W solar panels, embodying ecological autonomy [*solar panels provide partial energy for the system*]

Together, these create a **robotic, enigmatic form**‚Äîa technological organism that protects, responds, and evolves with ecological sustainability, powered by renewable energy like natural organisms drawing sustenance from the sun.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

> "Think of this system as a **living organism** where each part works independently but contributes to the whole"

#### **üß† The Brain: Web Control Panel**
- You interact with a simple web interface on your phone or computer‚Äîadjusting lights, changing music, tuning the radio. Your command travels instantly to the Raspberry Pi's brain.

#### **üí¨ The Nervous System: Independent Services**
- Each function (lights, sound, radio, fan) runs as its own "organ"‚Äîchecking every second for new instructions, making decisions, and updating its status. If one part fails, the others keep working. Like a living body that heals itself.

#### **üé≠ Real-Time Response**
1. **You touch a slider** on the web interface
2. **Within 1 second**, your command reaches the service
3. **The service responds immediately** (lights change, music plays, fan speeds up)
4. **Within 15 seconds**, the dashboard updates to confirm the change

#### **üîß Smart Hardware**
- **Light & Temperature Sensors**: Detect brightness and heat levels automatically
- **FM Radio Module**: Scans and tunes radio frequencies
- **Audio Processing**: Records your voice, mixes it with music, creates soundscapes
- **LED Controllers**: Respond to sound levels, making lights dance to music
- **Fan System**: Creates wind patterns‚Äîbreathing with the installation, responding to temperature and light
- **Solar Power**: 6 panels (2W each) harvest sunlight ‚Üí Waveshare Power Manager ‚Üí USB-C to Raspberry Pi‚Äîcompletely self-sustaining

#### **üõ°Ô∏è Self-Healing Design**
Three guardian systems watch over everything 24/7:
- **Exhibition Watchdog** checks health every 2 minutes
- **Service Protection** prevents accidental shutdowns every 4 minutes
- **Automatic Recovery** restarts crashed services within 2-3 minutes

If the power goes out, everything remembers its settings and resumes automatically when power returns‚Äîlike a hibernating animal waking up exactly where it left off.

## üõ†Ô∏è Service Management System (v3.0)

**Code of the Sea v3.0** introduces a comprehensive service management system that ensures reliable, single-instance operation of all services with proper startup, shutdown, and monitoring capabilities.

### **üîß Systemd Service Configuration**

The system uses multiple systemd services for automatic startup and management:

#### **cos-control-panel.service** (Main Application)
- **Description**: Code of the Sea Control Panel - Main Flask web application
- **User**: payas (runs as regular user, not root)
- **Working Directory**: `/home/payas/cos`
- **Command**: `/home/payas/venv/bin/python /home/payas/cos/run.py unified --no-debug`
- **Auto-restart**: Yes (15-second delay)
- **Resource Limits**: 768MB RAM, 70% CPU quota
- **Dependencies**: Waits for network and sound systems, starts after cos-services.service

#### **cos-services.service** (Service Startup)
- **Description**: COS All Services Startup (Optimized) - Starts all individual services
- **Type**: oneshot (runs once then exits)
- **Script**: `/home/payas/cos/scripts/startup_services_optimized.sh`
- **Startup Logic**: Conflict-aware sequential startup with audio system coordination
- **Timeout**: 120 seconds for complete startup sequence
- **Dependencies**: Waits for network and sound systems

1. **Phase 1**: Non-audio services (Radio, Fan) - 15-second system readiness wait
2. **Audio System Check**: Waits for PulseAudio/ALSA to be ready
3. **Phase 2**: Audio-dependent services (LED primary, then Broadcast)
4. **Phase 3**: Mixing service (starts in disabled mode to prevent conflicts)
5. **Health Check**: Verifies all services started successfully

#### **Service Management Commands**
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status cos-control-panel
sudo systemctl status cos-services

# Start/stop main services
sudo systemctl start cos-control-panel
sudo systemctl stop cos-control-panel

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u cos-control-panel -f
sudo journalctl -u cos-services -f

# Enable/disable auto-start
sudo systemctl enable cos-control-panel
sudo systemctl disable cos-control-panel
```

### **üéØ Key Features**

## üîß Configuration

### üìÅ Playlist File Management

**Playlist File Limit Configuration:**

The broadcast service automatically manages playlist files to prevent storage overflow. By default, only the **5 newest** audio files are kept in the broadcast media directory, with older files automatically deleted.

**To change the playlist file limit:**

1. **Location**: Edit `/home/payas/cos/mixing/mixing_menu.py`
2. **Line**: 664
3. **Change**: Replace `5` with your desired number of files to keep

```python
# Line 664 in mixing/mixing_menu.py
cleanup_old_files(BROADCAST_MEDIA_DIR, 5)  # Change this 5 to your desired limit
```

**How it works:**
- Cleanup happens automatically after each audio mixing operation
- Files are sorted by modification time (newest first)
- Only the specified number of newest files are kept
- Older files are deleted and logged with "Removed old file: filename.mp3"
- The broadcast media directory is located at `/home/payas/cos/broadcast/media/`

**Examples:**
```python

### üí° **Musical LED Brightness Configuration**

**Advanced Musical LED Settings:**

The Musical LED mode includes several advanced configuration options for fine-tuning the audio-reactive behavior:

#### **Performance Toggle**
```json
"musical_led_active": "active"  // or "off"
```
- **"active"**: LED responds to audio/RMS levels normally
- **"off"**: LED is always turned off, regardless of any audio input (bypasses brightness change thresholds)

#### **Asymmetric Brightness Thresholds**

The system uses different sensitivity thresholds for brighter vs darker changes to optimize musical responsiveness:

**Constants in `led/lighting_menu.py`:**
```python
BRIGHTNESS_MINIMUM_CHANGE_HIGHER = 20  # Minimum change for brighter (increasing)
BRIGHTNESS_MINIMUM_CHANGE_LOWER = 30   # Minimum change for darker (decreasing)
```

**How it works:**
- **Getting Brighter**: LED responds faster to volume increases (20-point threshold)
- **Getting Darker**: LED is more conservative about dimming (30-point threshold)
- **Musical Benefit**: More responsive to loud music moments while preventing quick dimming during brief quiet parts
- **Threshold Bypass**: Max/min brightness (‚â•95% or ‚â§5%) always updates immediately, regardless of thresholds

#### **Below Threshold Behavior**
```json
"musical_led_below_threshold": "off",     // or "minimum"
"musical_led_minimum_brightness": "3"     // 0-100 brightness level
```
- **"off"**: Turn LED completely off when audio is below quiet threshold
- **"minimum"**: Keep LED on at minimum brightness level when audio is quiet

#### **RMS Thresholds**
```json
"mic_rms_quiet": "0.002",   // RMS value considered "quiet/emotional" music
"mic_rms_loud": "0.04"      // RMS value considered "loud/energetic" music
```

**Configuration Examples:**

**Responsive Setup** (for dynamic music):
```json
{
  "musical_led_active": "active",
  "musical_led_below_threshold": "off",
  "mic_rms_quiet": "0.001",
  "mic_rms_loud": "0.03"
}
```

**Ambient Setup** (for background music):
```json
{
  "musical_led_active": "active",
  "musical_led_below_threshold": "minimum",
  "musical_led_minimum_brightness": "5",
  "mic_rms_quiet": "0.005",
  "mic_rms_loud": "0.05"
}
```

**Disabled Setup** (LED always off):
```json
{
  "musical_led_active": "off"
}
```

### Device Configuration (Secure Setup)

**üîê Important**: Device credentials are stored separately from code for security.

1. **Copy Configuration Template**
   ```bash
   cp config/devices.example.json config/devices.json
   ```

2. **Update Device Credentials**
   Edit `config/devices.json` with your actual device information:
   ```json
   {
     "led": {
       "tuya_controller": {
         "device_id": "your_device_id_from_tinytuya_wizard",
         "device_ip": "192.168.1.XXX",
         "device_key": "your_device_key_from_tinytuya_wizard"
       }
     },
     "fan": {
       "grove_mosfet": {
         "fan_pwm_pin": 18,
         "pwm_frequency": 10
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Security Note**: The `config/devices.json` file is automatically excluded from git commits to protect your credentials.

### Main Application Configuration
Edit `unified_config.json` for global settings:

```json
{
    "mode": "dashboard",
    "debug": false,
    "auto_start_services": ["broadcast", "led"]
}
```

### Module-Specific Configuration
Each module has its own configuration file in the respective directory.

## üé® Art Installation Setup
