## 🛠️ Service Management System (v3.0)

**Code of the Sea v3.0** introduces a comprehensive service management system that ensures reliable, single-instance operation of all services with proper startup, shutdown, and monitoring capabilities.

### **🔧 Systemd Service Configuration**

The system uses multiple systemd services for automatic startup and management:

#### **cos-control-panel.service** (Main Application)
- **Description**: Code of the Sea Control Panel - Main Flask web application
- **User**: payas (runs as regular user, not root)
- **Working Directory**: `/home/payas/cos`
- **Command**: `/home/payas/venv/bin/python /home/payas/cos/run.py unified --no-debug`
- **Auto-restart**: Yes (15-second delay)
- **Resource Limits**: 768MB RAM, 70% CPU quota
- **Dependencies**: Waits for network and sound systems, starts after cos-services.service

#### **cos-services.service** (Service Startup)
- **Description**: COS All Services Startup (Optimized) - Starts all individual services
- **Type**: oneshot (runs once then exits)
- **Script**: `/home/payas/cos/scripts/startup_services_optimized.sh`
- **Startup Logic**: Conflict-aware sequential startup with audio system coordination
- **Timeout**: 120 seconds for complete startup sequence
- **Dependencies**: Waits for network and sound systems

#### **Startup Sequence** (startup_services_optimized.sh)
1. **Phase 1**: Non-audio services (Radio, Fan) - 15-second system readiness wait
2. **Audio System Check**: Waits for PulseAudio/ALSA to be ready
3. **Phase 2**: Audio-dependent services (LED primary, then Broadcast)
4. **Phase 3**: Mixing service (starts in disabled mode to prevent conflicts)
5. **Health Check**: Verifies all services started successfully

#### **Service Management Commands**
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status cos-control-panel
sudo systemctl status cos-services

# Start/stop main services
sudo systemctl start cos-control-panel
sudo systemctl stop cos-control-panel

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u cos-control-panel -f
sudo journalctl -u cos-services -f

# Enable/disable auto-start
sudo systemctl enable cos-control-panel
sudo systemctl disable cos-control-panel
```

### **🎯 Key Features**
- **Single Instance Enforcement**: Prevents duplicate service processes that cause conflicts
- **Automatic Process Cleanup**: Intelligent detection and removal of zombie/stuck processes
- **Centralized Management**: Unified control system for all services
- **Enhanced Error Recovery**: Robust error handling with automatic retry mechanisms
- **PulseAudio Integration**: Improved microphone recording with fallback to ALSA
- **Debug Mode Optimization**: Fixed Flask debug mode to prevent process duplication

### **🔧 Service Management Scripts**

All services now have dedicated management scripts in `/scripts/`:

```bash
# Individual Service Management
./manage_radio_service.sh {start|stop|restart|status}
./manage_led_service.sh {start|stop|restart|status}
./manage_fan_service.sh {start|stop|restart|status}
./manage_broadcast_service.sh {start|stop|restart|status}
./manage_mixing_service.sh {start|stop|restart|status}
./manage_unified_app.sh {start|stop|restart|status}

# Master Service Control
./manage_all_services.sh {start|stop|restart|status} [service_name]
```

### **⚡ Quick Service Commands**

From the main directory (`/home/payas/cos/`):

```bash
# Control all services
./services start           # Start all services
./services stop            # Stop all services
./services restart         # Restart all services
./services status          # Check all service status

# Control individual services
./services start radio     # Start only radio service
./services restart mixing  # Restart only mixing service
./services status led      # Check only LED service status
```

### **🔄 Smart Process Management**

Each service management script implements:

1. **Pre-start Cleanup**: Automatically kills existing instances before starting
2. **PID File Management**: Tracks process IDs with cleanup of stale files
3. **Graceful Shutdown**: SIGTERM followed by SIGKILL if needed
4. **Process Verification**: Confirms successful start/stop operations
5. **Comprehensive Status**: Detailed process state reporting

### **📊 Enhanced Monitoring**

The unified app now provides:
- **Real-time Service Health**: Color-coded status indicators
- **Process Tracking**: Live PID monitoring and restart detection
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic restart on service failures

## 🔧 Configuration

### 📁 Playlist File Management

**Playlist File Limit Configuration:**

The broadcast service automatically manages playlist files to prevent storage overflow. By default, only the **5 newest** audio files are kept in the broadcast media directory, with older files automatically deleted.

**To change the playlist file limit:**

1. **Location**: Edit `/home/payas/cos/mixing/mixing_menu.py`
2. **Line**: 664
3. **Change**: Replace `5` with your desired number of files to keep

```python
# Line 664 in mixing/mixing_menu.py
cleanup_old_files(BROADCAST_MEDIA_DIR, 5)  # Change this 5 to your desired limit
```

**How it works:**
- Cleanup happens automatically after each audio mixing operation
- Files are sorted by modification time (newest first)
- Only the specified number of newest files are kept
- Older files are deleted and logged with "Removed old file: filename.mp3"
- The broadcast media directory is located at `/home/payas/cos/broadcast/media/`

**Examples:**
```python
cleanup_old_files(BROADCAST_MEDIA_DIR, 10)  # Keep 10 files
cleanup_old_files(BROADCAST_MEDIA_DIR, 20)  # Keep 20 files
cleanup_old_files(BROADCAST_MEDIA_DIR, 3)   # Keep only 3 files
```

### 💡 **Musical LED Brightness Configuration**

**Advanced Musical LED Settings:**

The Musical LED mode includes several advanced configuration options for fine-tuning the audio-reactive behavior:

#### **Performance Toggle**
```json
"musical_led_active": "active"  // or "off"
```
- **"active"**: LED responds to audio/RMS levels normally
- **"off"**: LED is always turned off, regardless of any audio input (bypasses brightness change thresholds)

#### **Asymmetric Brightness Thresholds**

The system uses different sensitivity thresholds for brighter vs darker changes to optimize musical responsiveness:

**Constants in `led/lighting_menu.py`:**
```python
BRIGHTNESS_MINIMUM_CHANGE_HIGHER = 20  # Minimum change for brighter (increasing)
BRIGHTNESS_MINIMUM_CHANGE_LOWER = 30   # Minimum change for darker (decreasing)
```

**How it works:**
- **Getting Brighter**: LED responds faster to volume increases (20-point threshold)
- **Getting Darker**: LED is more conservative about dimming (30-point threshold)
- **Musical Benefit**: More responsive to loud music moments while preventing quick dimming during brief quiet parts
- **Threshold Bypass**: Max/min brightness (≥95% or ≤5%) always updates immediately, regardless of thresholds

#### **Below Threshold Behavior**
```json
"musical_led_below_threshold": "off",     // or "minimum"
"musical_led_minimum_brightness": "3"     // 0-100 brightness level
```
- **"off"**: Turn LED completely off when audio is below quiet threshold
- **"minimum"**: Keep LED on at minimum brightness level when audio is quiet

#### **RMS Thresholds**
```json
"mic_rms_quiet": "0.002",   // RMS value considered "quiet/emotional" music
"mic_rms_loud": "0.04"      // RMS value considered "loud/energetic" music
```

**Configuration Examples:**

**Responsive Setup** (for dynamic music):
```json
{
  "musical_led_active": "active",
  "musical_led_below_threshold": "off",
  "mic_rms_quiet": "0.001",
  "mic_rms_loud": "0.03"
}
```

**Ambient Setup** (for background music):
```json
{
  "musical_led_active": "active",
  "musical_led_below_threshold": "minimum",
  "musical_led_minimum_brightness": "5",
  "mic_rms_quiet": "0.005",
  "mic_rms_loud": "0.05"
}
```

**Disabled Setup** (LED always off):
```json
{
  "musical_led_active": "off"
}
```

### Device Configuration (Secure Setup)

**🔐 Important**: Device credentials are stored separately from code for security.

1. **Copy Configuration Template**
   ```bash
   cp config/devices.example.json config/devices.json
   ```

2. **Update Device Credentials**
   Edit `config/devices.json` with your actual device information:
